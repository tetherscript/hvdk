The HVDK is a Windows SDK that allows you to send data to Tetherscript's Virtual HID Keyboard, Joystick, Mouse and Gamepad drivers.  These are the same drivers used by Tetherscript's ControlMyJoystick program.

These examples were created on Delphi 10.1 Berlin and Visual Studio C# .Net 3.5/4.72(with 64-bit builds).

These examples require that the HVDK Standard or Professional drivers are installed.  They are available from https://www.tetherscript.com/hid-driver-kit-home/.  The driver source code has not and will not made available publicly.
